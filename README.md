# Payment integration - Paypal ReactJS

## Instruction

For integrating Paypal payment system, we need to create an application on the paypal developer account. It provides a `CLIENT_ID` for your application. Please create your application and put the CLIENT_ID in the environment file by creating `.env` in root folder:

```bash
REACT_APP_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
```

Then, to get started, easily type:

```bash
$ npm start
```
